/**
 * A factor is a number that divides another number evenly with no reminder. In other words, factors are
 * numbers that can be multiplied together to get another number. This also means that the division of a number
 * with all the factors will result in 0 remainders.
 *
 * Examples:
 * Factors of 4 = 1, 2, 4.
 * Factors of 6 = 1, 2, 3
